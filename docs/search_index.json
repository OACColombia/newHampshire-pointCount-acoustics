Our latent state \\(X_{m,s}\\) is the site-level log-abundance state for species \\(s\\) at site \\(m\\), which follows a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, OU, diffusion for Gompertz on log-scale: \\[ X_{t+1, s} = a_s + c_s * X_{t, s} + \\epsilon_{t}; ~ \\epsilon \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma_s^2) \\] where \\(a_s\\) control the drift (the initial condition at \\(t=1\\), and then equivalent to the maximum growth rate in a population model), \\(c_s\\) controls the mean-reverting dynamic (such as the strength of density dependence, \\(c = 1 + b\\) in a population model), and \\(\\epsilon_{t}\\) captures stochasticity in the process, distributed as a normal random variable with some noise of the process \\(\\sigma_s^2\\). Under stationarity and independence across sites, we can estimate the mean of the log-counts as a function of the control drift and mean-reverting dynamic: \\[ \\text{E}[X_{\\infty, s}] = \\mu_s= \\frac{a_s}{1-c_s} \\] and variance: \\[ \\text{Var}[X_{\\infty, s}] = \\frac{\\sigma_s^2}{1-c_s^2} \\] For the simulations, we will sample \\(X_{m,s}\\) i.i.d. (independent and identical distributed) across \\(m\\) from this stationary distribution. The expected counts per site: \\[ \\text{E}[\\lambda_{m,s}^{Counts}] = \\text{E}[\\exp(X_{m,s})] = \\exp(\\mu_s + 0.5 \\times \\sigma_{X,s}^2) \\] For point counts of 0.78 ha, 50m fixed radius. The observed point-count counts are \\(Y_{m,s}^{Counts} \\sim \\text{Binomial}(\\text{size} = \\text{round}(\\lambda_{m,s}^{Counts}), \\text{p} = \\tau_s)\\), where \\(\\tau_s\\) ranges between 0 and 1, and is a species-specific detection probability. The expected counts from the acoustic detections data is \\[ \\text{E}[\\lambda_{m,s}^{Acoust}] = \\text{E}[\\exp(\\alpha_ + \\gamma_s X_{m,s})] = \\exp(\\alpha_ + \\gamma_s \\mu_s + 0.5 \\gamma^2_s \\sigma_{X,s}^2) \\] This expected count could use a fixed ratio \\(\\zeta_s\\) \\[ \\text{E}[\\lambda_{m,s}^{Acoust}] = \\zeta_s \\times \\text{E}[\\lambda_{m,s}^{Counts}] \\] then, \\(\\alpha_s = \\log(\\zeta_s) + \\mu_s (1-\\gamma_s) + 0.5\\sigma_{X,s}^2(1-\\gamma_s^2)\\). The acoustic detection data are \\(Y_{m,s}^{Acous} \\sim \\text{Negative~Binomial}(r_s, p_{m,s})\\), where \\(p_{m,s} = \\frac{r_s}{r_s+\\lambda_{m,s}^{(0.78)}}\\) represents the success parameter, being a ratio of the overdispersion parameter \\(r_s\\) and the sum of the overdispersion parameter and the mean expected counts \\(C_{m,s}^{Acoustic~Detections} = \\lambda_{m,s}^{(0.78)} = e^{X_{m,s}}\\). These expected counts at the point (site) level (0.78 ha, 50m radius) then are extrapolated to the entire area of 100 ha as: \\(\\Lambda_s^{(100)} = \\frac{100 \\times \\lambda_{m,s}^{(0.78)}}{0.78}\\) (again, following the approach in ).
